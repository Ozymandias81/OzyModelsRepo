This is my personal repository of 3d models ripped from several games & free stuff.
These models are intended to be used under GZDoom sourceport on freeware projects.
Models comes mainly with embedded skins and nested folders, usually with no animations.
Check CREDITS.txt for a complete and exhaustive list.
An example map is included within this pack, which can be built via the BUILD.bat to run
it from GZDoom using Doom 2 as main IWAD.
All borrowed resources present in this repo belong ONLY to respective owners/creators.
