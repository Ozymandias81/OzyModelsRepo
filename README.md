Welcome to my personal repository of 3d Models ripped from several games & in the WWW.
These models are mainly intended to be used under GZDoom sourceport, but you can adapt
it for Zandronum and Doomsday if you know how to do it, so it's up to you.
Models comes mainly with embedded skins and nested folders, usually with no animations.
Check CREDITS.txt for a complete and exhaustive list.
An example map is included within this pack, which can be built via the BUILD.bat to run
it from GZDoom.
I DON'T PLAN TO DO ANY MONEY WITH THESE RESOURCES SO CONSIDER THIS FREEWARE.
