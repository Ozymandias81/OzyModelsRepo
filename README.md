Welcome to my personal repository of 3d Models ripped from several games & in the WWW.
These models are mainly intended to be used under GZDoom sourceport.
Models comes mainly with embedded skins and nested folders, usually with no animations.
Check CREDITS.txt for a complete and exhaustive list.
An example map is included within this pack, which can be built via the BUILD.bat to run
it from GZDoom.
