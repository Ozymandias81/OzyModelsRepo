Welcome to my Personal Repository of 3d Models ripped from several games & in the WWW
for NON-COMMERCIAL purposes.
These models are mainly intended to be used with Doom sourceport engines such as
GZDoom and Zandronum, but even Doomsday if you know how to convert them.
Here you will find an astonishing collection of .md3 / .obj models with usually
embedded skins and without animations, extracted from several games that you can retrieve
from CREDITS.txt.
I DON'T PLAN TO DO ANY MONEY WITH THESE RESOURCES SO CONSIDER IT FREEWARE.
This pack has an example map where some of the models can be seen in game an tested using
GZDoom Builder or building the .pk3 itself via the BUILD.bat within the repository.

Editors used:
BSAOpt, Blender, Bulk Rename Utility Dragon UnPacker, GIMP, GZDoomBuilder, HxD Hex Editor,
MilkShape, Misfit3d, NifSkope, Notepad++, Slade3, XModel Exporter

Known Bugs:
- WILL BE UPDATED FROM TIME TO TIME
